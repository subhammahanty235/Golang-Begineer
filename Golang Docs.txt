Hello World Code : -->
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
	    fmt.Println("Hello World")
    }

Variables : --> 
In Go, there are different types of variables, for example:

    int- stores integers (whole numbers), such as 123 or -123
    float32- stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
    string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
    bool- stores values with two states: true or false

    syntax : var variablename type = value
                or 
            variablename := value

    Declare Multiple variables :
            var a, b, c, d int = 1, 3, 5, 7
    

<--

Constant : -->
    If a variable should have a fixed value that cannot be changed, you can use the const keyword.

    The const keyword declares the variable as "constant", which means that it is unchangeable and read-only.

    syntax : const CONSTNAME type = value

<--

For Loop --> 
    i:=0; - Initialize the loop counter (i), and set the start value to 0
    i < 5; - Continue the loop as long as i is less than 5
    i++ - Increase the loop counter value by 1 for each iteration

<--

Structures : ---> 
    A struct (short for structure) is used to create a collection of members of different data types, into a single variable.

    While arrays are used to store multiple values of the same data type into a single variable, structs are used to store multiple values of different data types into a single variable.

    A struct can be useful for grouping data together to create records.
    type struct_name struct {
        member1 datatype;
        member2 datatype;
        member3 datatype;
        ...
    }
