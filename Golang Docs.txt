Hello World Code : -->
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
	    fmt.Println("Hello World")
    }

Variables : --> 
In Go, there are different types of variables, for example:

    int- stores integers (whole numbers), such as 123 or -123
    float32- stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
    string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
    bool- stores values with two states: true or false

    syntax : var variablename type = value
                or 
            variablename := value

    Declare Multiple variables :
            var a, b, c, d int = 1, 3, 5, 7
    

<--

Constant : -->
    If a variable should have a fixed value that cannot be changed, you can use the const keyword.

    The const keyword declares the variable as "constant", which means that it is unchangeable and read-only.

    syntax : const CONSTNAME type = value
